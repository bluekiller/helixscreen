///  - an attribute named `callback` or `event_cb`, or ending `_callback` or `_cb`, has
///    the value `plugin_event`;
///  - `user_data` is an event target owned by `id`, optionally followed by `:<arg>`;
///  - an attribute named `subject`, ending `_subject`, or starting `bind_` names a
///    subject owned by `id`;
///  - an attribute named `cond` or ending `_cond` is an expression whose every
///    identifier is owned by `id`; numbers, operators, whitespace and parentheses are
///    the only other tokens allowed;
///  - none of those attributes takes a `$prop` value, since a prop default cannot be
///    checked against the attribute it feeds.
