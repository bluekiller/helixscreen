/**
 * @brief Clears a raw pointer the moment LVGL deletes the indev it names
 *
 * lv_evdev deletes its own device when a read fails, as it does when a USB
 * touch panel is unplugged, and lv_deinit() deletes every remaining indev at
 * shutdown. A caller holding a raw copy of that pointer outside the object
 * that opened it - DisplayManager's m_pointer/m_keyboard mirror whatever
 * display backend created them, and PointerFrameHook fronts a device's read
 * callback without owning it - has no way to learn the device is gone unless
 * something is listening for LV_EVENT_DELETE.
 *
 * The optional callback runs after the slot is cleared, so a caller with its
 * own bookkeeping tied to the device (PointerFrameHook drops its frame
 * transform entry) can fold that into the same delete notification instead
 * of registering a second LV_EVENT_DELETE listener. Main thread only, like
 * every indev.
