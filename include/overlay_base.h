 * @file overlay_base.h
 * @brief Abstract base class for overlay panels with lifecycle hooks
 *
 * @pattern Two-phase init (init_subjects -> XML -> callbacks); lifecycle hooks via
 * NavigationManager
 * @threading Main thread only
 *
 * OverlayBase provides lifecycle management for overlay panels:
 * - on_activate() called when overlay becomes visible (slide-in complete)
 * - on_deactivate() called when overlay is being hidden (before slide-out)
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Flow
 *
 * ### Overlay pushed:
 * 1. If first overlay: main panel's on_deactivate() is called
 * 2. If nested: previous overlay's on_deactivate() is called
 * 3. Overlay shows with slide-in animation
 * 4. Overlay's on_activate() is called
 *
 * ### Overlay popped (go_back):
 * 1. Overlay's on_deactivate() is called
 * 2. Slide-out animation plays
 * 3. If returning to main panel: main panel's on_activate() is called
 * 4. If returning to previous overlay: previous overlay's on_activate() is called
 *
 * ## Usage Pattern:
 *
 * A behaviour-free overlay is its name and XML component; show() does the rest
 * (subjects once, callbacks + create on each build, register + push):
 *
 * @code
 * class MyOverlay : public OverlayBase {
 *   public:
 *     const char* get_name() const override { return "My Overlay"; }
 *     const char* xml_component() const override { return "my_overlay"; }
 * };
 * MyOverlay& get_my_overlay() { return helix::lazy_global<MyOverlay>("MyOverlay"); }
 *
 * get_my_overlay().show(parent_screen);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Override init_subjects() for owned subjects, register_callbacks() for XML
 * callbacks, before_show() for per-open work that needs the root, and
 * destroy_on_close() to free the widget tree whenever the overlay is popped.
 *
 * @see NetworkSettingsOverlay for reference implementation

 * 2. Unregisters the close callback and overlay instance from

 * 3. Breadcrumbs "ovrl_dst" so crashes in the close path can be pinned to

 * 4. Runs hooks.before_delete while every pointer is still valid AND the tree
 *    is still attached — owners whose sub-objects own widgets in the subtree
 *    (AMS sidebars, context menus, modals) drop them here
 * 5. Deletes per @p how (both strategies defer the actual free — sync
 *    deletion inside an overlay close callback corrupts LVGL's global event
 *    list when chained from an UpdateQueue batch, #776/#840)
 * 6. Nulls @p root, and @p cached_panel when the caller passed one (it may
 *    point at @p root itself)
 * 7. Runs hooks.after_delete — the widget tree is still alive (hidden,
 *    off-tree) until the async tick, so owners can null child-widget
 *    pointers that must stay dereferenceable during teardown
 *
 * The owner object (subjects, state) survives — only the widget tree is
 * destroyed; the next open re-creates it.
