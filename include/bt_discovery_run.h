/**
 * @file bt_discovery_run.h
 * @brief A plugin context shared with worker threads, and a discovery scan run on one.
 *
 * Both Bluetooth settings overlays scan the same way: helix_bt_discover() blocks for the
 * whole scan, so it runs on a detached worker, and its C callback fires on the plugin's
 * bus thread. The worker can outlive a Stop, a rescan, and the overlay itself, so
 * everything it touches is owned through shared_ptr here rather than by the overlay.
