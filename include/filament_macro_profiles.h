/**
 * @file filament_macro_profiles.h
 * @brief What a printer's stock filament macros do for themselves.
 *
 * Most load/unload macros expect the hotend to already be at temperature, so
 * every dispatch surface heats first and waits. Some firmwares ship macros that
 * drive the hotend themselves, and preheating in front of one of those makes the
 * user wait twice and can settle on a different temperature than the macro then
 * commands.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place that names which firmware's macros behave that
 * way. Generic code (the filament panel, the AMS sidebar, the shared dispatch
 * ladder) asks the capability question and never names a firmware.
 *
 * Adding a firmware means adding one row to the table in
 * filament_macro_profiles.cpp - no call site changes.
 *
 * The backend tier has its own answer to the same question,
 * AmsBackend::supports_auto_heat_on_load(). Both feed
 * helix::ui::preheat_skip_reason(), which is where a caller should ask.

 * stock Klipper, so a printer that defines one is running that firmware. A
 * generic name a user could plausibly write themselves (LOAD_FILAMENT,
 * UNLOAD_FILAMENT, M701, M702) is never in the table, because there the name
 * proves nothing about the body - those users are served by the
 * "Allow cold load/unload" setting instead.
 *
 * Klipper macro names are case-insensitive; @p macro_name may be in any case.
