/**
 * @brief What sits behind the overlay stack: the dismiss backdrop and its bookkeeping
 *
 * The primary backdrop is a darkened snapshot of the screen taken when the first
 * overlay opens (or a translucent dim layer where a snapshot is too costly). It is
 * a child of the screen, so any path that deletes the screen frees it without
 * going through the overlay stack; the handle clears itself when that happens.
 * Deletions go through safe_delete_deferred, since they run inside UpdateQueue
 * drains. Nested overlays can carry a backdrop of their own, tracked per overlay.
