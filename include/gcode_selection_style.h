/**
 * @file gcode_selection_style.h
 * @brief The single answer to "how does a selected or excluded object look".
 *
 * Two renderers draw G-code:
 *   - GCodeLayerRenderer  (2D isometric, all platforms, and the only renderer on
 *                          every non-GLES target: ad5m, ad5x, cc1, k1, k2, u1)
 *   - GCodeGLESRenderer   (3D, ENABLE_GLES_3D targets only: pi*, x86*)
 *
 * This header owns the decision, so both draw a selected or excluded object the
 * same way. Emission stays with each renderer, exactly like
 * AABB::for_each_bracket_arm() owns the bracket geometry while the renderers
 * differ in how they draw the resulting segments.
 *
 * Scope: selection and exclusion only. Base extrusion color, travel styling, and
 * depth/ghost shading remain each renderer's business.

/**
 * @brief The three selection colors, resolved once from ui_xml/gcode_tokens.xml.
 *
 * They are XML tokens (`gcode_selection_outline`, `_excluded`, `_bracket`), which
 * makes the XML the single source of truth and this struct the way the value
 * reaches a renderer.
 *
 * The member defaults are NOT a production fallback - every shipped tree
 * carries ui_xml, and no packaging rule omits it. They exist for the headless
 * unit tests: LVGLTestFixture brings up LVGL without theme_manager, so no token
 * is registered and palette_from_theme() has nothing to read. Keeping them equal
 * to the token file is what test_gcode_selection_style's drift case enforces.
 *
 * WHY A STRUCT AND NOT A LOOKUP AT THE POINT OF USE. Reading a token means
 * walking LVGL's const registry, which is main-thread-only, and the values are
 * consumed in software-rasterizer inner loops and on the ghost worker thread.
 * So a renderer resolves the palette ONCE on the main thread and carries it:
 * as a member for the cache path, and copied into the ghost worker's snapshot
 * alongside its other `local_*` state. Calling palette_from_theme() from the
 * ghost thread would be a background-thread LVGL access.
