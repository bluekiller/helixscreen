 *
 * A "selector" screen offers the user one pick out of a long list that is too
 * large to scroll comfortably on small panels: the wizard's printer models
 * (~105 entries), the widget catalog (#1016), any future capability picker.
 * The interaction is always the same two moves — type-to-filter across every
 * entry, and drill into one group at a time — so the classification lives here
 * as pure functions over a plain entry list and every caller maps the result to
 * its own widgets.
 *
 * Nothing in this header touches LVGL: the callers own rendering.
