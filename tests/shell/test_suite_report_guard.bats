# Meta-tests for scripts/run_suite_report.sh — the watch around the Catch2 run
# that make test-vacuous and make test-order-dependence both consume.
#
# The report file is the only progress signal that run has. Test stdout must be
# discarded (ANSI status bytes from tests that shell out are not legal XML, and
# they land in the report if the two streams share a destination), so from
# outside, a suite sitting inside one test case and a suite that is merely slow
# look identical: no console output, one process, a file that will finish
# eventually. Every gate downstream waits on it either way.
#
# So the guard is the check, and these tests are about the guard going off. A
# fake suite stands in for the real one, which keeps a contract about a
# 7-minute run testable in seconds. Each case wraps the script in `timeout` for
# a reason: with the guard removed the run never returns, and a test that hangs
# reads as infrastructure trouble rather than as the regression it is. The
# timeout turns that into exit 124, which is not the 1 the assertions want.
