# Diagnostic-upload gate wiring (prestonbrown/helixscreen#1410).
#
# The runtime behaviour is covered by tests/unit/test_diag_upload_gate.cpp.
# What can break SILENTLY is the plumbing this file pins: the compile default
# (official packaging builds upload, everything else defaults off), the
# docker-boundary forwarding, the build-features stamp, and the deploy-time
# env stamp that keeps our rigs uploading. Lose any of those and the build is
# green while a whole class of binaries quietly stops reporting — or a fork's
# build quietly keeps hitting our CDN.
