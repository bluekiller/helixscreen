"""Golden captures for each reachable screen.

Screen tokens and their navigation come from `scripts/screenshot-recipes.sh`
(the `SCREENSHOT_RECIPE` table), so this corpus and `screenshot.sh` reach each
screen the same way. Bash sources the script and prints the table through its
own accessors; Python only splits `"navigate x; click y"` into steps.

Every capture assumes overlay/panel transitions render instantly.
`HelixApp.start()` (`helix/app.py`) seeds `animations_enabled: false` into each
instance's private config dir; if animations ever come back on by default, the
fix belongs there, not in a fixture here.

# Subset of scripts/screenshot-recipes.sh's tokens. Every (screen, variant) pair
# here is byte-identical across independent app boots. The rest stay out
# because their content is not a function of the boot:
#
#   - `home`, `controls`, `filament`, `fan`: the mock's `simulation_thread_`
#     (moonraker_client_mock.cpp) drifts temperatures and the motor-idle timer.
#     `freeze()` parks that thread from the moment it is called, so the value
#     it parks on is wherever the drift had reached, and `wait_idle()` has
#     nothing to gate on. `fan` is a card on the same Controls panel and shows
#     the same temperature card; `filament` also charts usage against the wall
#     clock.
#   - `console`: lines are stamped with the wall-clock time.
#   - `preflight-check`: the modal's dim backdrop is the Home panel, whose
#     temperature drift shows faintly through the scrim.
#   - `camera`: the "Connecting Camera..." spinner runs its own `lv_anim`,
#     independent of `animations_enabled`, so `freeze()` catches an arbitrary
#     arc position.
#   - `ams`: the Bypass spool icon (`ui_bypass_spool_widget.cpp`) renders about
#     300 px differently depending on whether its canvas was refreshed once or
#     twice to reach the same final colour and fill, and the external-spool
#     sync decides that count. `tests/ui/goldens/ams.png` waits for that widget
#     to render the same either way.
