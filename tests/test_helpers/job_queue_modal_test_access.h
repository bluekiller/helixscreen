/**
 * @brief Friend access to JobQueueModal::start_job().
 *
 * start_job() is reachable in production only from a row's click callback, and
 * its guard runs before any widget is touched - so a test can call it on a
 * modal that was never shown. That is the whole point: the guard is the unit,
 * and building the modal's widget tree to reach it would test the XML instead.
 *
 * register_callbacks() binds the names job_queue_row.xml's event_cbs resolve,
 * which must exist before a row is created. attach_row_data() and set_active()
 * give a bare row the job and the modal those callbacks act on.
