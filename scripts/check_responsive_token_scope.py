"""Check that responsive design tokens are declared at the top level of ui_xml/.

Token auto-discovery is top-level-only. It lists files with
theme_manager_find_xml_files() (src/ui/theme_manager.cpp) and recursive=false,
which skips every subdirectory, so only ui_xml/*.xml is ever parsed for `<px name="foo_small">` /
`<string name="foo_small">`. A responsive token declared in ui_xml/components/,
ui_xml/portrait/, ui_xml/micro/ — anywhere below the top level — is never
registered, and every `#foo` that references it silently resolves to nothing.
Neither side warns (prestonbrown/helixscreen#1211).

Recursing was the obvious fix and is the wrong one. Discovery is alphabetical
last-wins, so a portrait-only `nav_width_small` would shadow the base token
globally instead of only while the portrait variant is active. Discovery stays
top-level-only; this gate makes the constraint loud instead of silent.

WHAT IS FLAGGED
  A `<px>` or `<string>` declaration whose name ends in a breakpoint suffix
  (_micro, _tiny, _small, _medium, _large, _xlarge, _xxlarge) in any ui_xml file
  that is not directly in the top level of ui_xml/.

NOT FLAGGED
  - Component-local `<consts>` with no breakpoint suffix. ui_xml/components/
    files declare grid_gap, pin_dot_size, tray_default_height and similar; those
    resolve through the component's own const scope, not through discovery.
  - References. `height="#row_height_small"` from a variant file is exactly what
    variants are for — only the DECLARATION has to sit at the top level.
  - `name=` on anything else: a widget handle or an <api> <prop> is a different
    namespace and never reaches token discovery.

Exit 0 when every responsive token is top-level, 1 otherwise.
